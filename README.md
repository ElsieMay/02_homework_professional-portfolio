## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a dynamic, deployed portfolio for potential clients and future employers to peruse my skills in flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables through various sample projects. I solved the criteria of this potential employer by providing said portfolio, with a recent photo and examples of previous work. When clicking through the site, the UI scrolls to the corresponding sections, with titled images and responsive website design.

I learnt about code responsive design, media queries, a little bit of JavaScript, CSS variables, file structuring, flexbox and much more.
